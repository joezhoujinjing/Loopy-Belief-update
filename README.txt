A standord algorithm to implement loopy belief update. It includes the factor construction and clique tree construction. 

An example of Low Density Parity Check using LBU is given. The partition function will be updated soon. Due to the lack of partition, the efficiency of 
the LDPC computation is compromised. However, it is still efficient for simpler problems. When partition is applied, it has an efficiency advantage over
deep learning models.

ldpc36-1600 encoding/decoding format is used, feel free to change the coding scheme.

Run LDPC.py to test the example.
